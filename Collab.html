    What Durham University is doing to combat climate change:
</h2>

    <p2>    
      As of March 2021, Durham University added itself to the group known as the "The North East England Climate Coalition". 
      The group, made up of everything from other universities to governmental bodies, strives to reduce their own impact by investing in 
      innovative technology and research in environmental science. The main sectors that will be focused on are: geothermal energy, conservation, 
      biodiversity, and sustainable universities.

    <p2>    
        Some of the "world-leading" research includes re-engineering abandoned coal mines as a source of geothermal energy. Another initiative involves ways
        to utilize hydrogen as an alternate way of heating. Their efforts are not spent on energy alone, but also the growing water crisis. the NEECC is working
        with the governmental agencies (specifically with Northumbrian Water and Environment Agency) to make sure that usage and waste is minimized in order 
        prevent any possible shortages.

    <p2>    
        Another focus of the NEECC is biodiversity. They have a strong interest in the preservation and maintenance of all wildlife. The coalition recognizes 
        the importance of biodiversity consciousness not only for the sake of the wildlife, but also for ourselves as humans. High levels of soil nutrients leads
        to better quality and quantity of crops. Many of these initiatives were/will be discussed at the Ecoschools event, and experts from these projects will 
        even advise the United Nations COP26 Climate Conference.
