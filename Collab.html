  <h1>Climate Change Project</h1>   
  <p>    
    "Earth's climate has changed throughout history. 
    Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, 
    with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of 
    the modern climate era — and of human civilization. 
    Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that 
    change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.
  </p>    
  <p>
    The current warming trend is of particular significance because it is unequivocally the result 
    of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over 
    millennia. It is undeniable that human activities have warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land and 
    that widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred."
