    "Earth's climate has changed throughout history. 
    Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, 
    with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of 
    the modern climate era — and of human civilization. 
    Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that 
    change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.
  </p>    
  <p>
    The current warming trend is of particular significance because it is unequivocally the result 
    of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over 
    millennia. It is undeniable that human activities have warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land and 
    that widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred."

        an organization that vets renewable energy options. If that isn’t possible for you, take a look at your electric bill; 
        many utilities now list other ways to support renewable sources on their monthly statements and websites.</td>

        So take shorter showers, turn off the tap while brushing your teeth, and switch to WaterSense-labeled fixtures and appliances.</td>

        processing, packaging, and shipping food—about 40 percent of which just winds up in the landfill. “If you’re wasting less food, you’re likely cutting 
        down on energy consumption,” Haq says. And since livestock products are among the most resource-intensive to produce, 
        eating meat-free meals can make a big difference, too.</td>
