    "Earth's climate has changed throughout history. 
    Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, 
    with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of 
    the modern climate era — and of human civilization. 
    Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that 
    change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.
  </p>    
  <p>
    The current warming trend is of particular significance because it is unequivocally the result 
    of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over 
    millennia. It is undeniable that human activities have warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land and 
    that widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred."

        down on energy consumption,” Haq says. And since livestock products are among the most resource-intensive to produce, 
        eating meat-free meals can make a big difference, too.</td>

  What Durham University is doing to combat climate change:
</h2>



  <p2>    
    As of March 2021, Durham University added itself to the group known as the "The North East England Climate Coalition". 
    The group, made up of everything from other universities to governmental bodies, strives to reduce their own impact by investing in 
    innovative technology and research in environmental science. The main sectors that will be focused on are: geothermal energy, conservation, 
    biodiversity, and sustainable universities. 
  </p2>    
  
  
  <p2>    
      Some of the "world-leading" research includes re-engineering abandoned coal mines as a source of geothermal energy. Another initiative involves ways
      to utilize hydrogen as an alternate way of heating. Their efforts are not spent on energy alone, but also the growing water crisis. the NEECC is working
      with the governmental agencies (specifically with Northumbrian Water and Environment Agency) to make sure that usage and waste is minimized in order 
      prevent any possible shortages.
  </p2>   

  <p2>    
      Another focus of the NEECC is biodiversity. They have a strong interest in the preservation and maintenance of all wildlife. The coalition recognizes 
      the importance of biodiversity consciousness not only for the sake of the wildlife, but also for ourselves as humans. High levels of soil nutrients leads
      to better quality and quantity of crops. Many of these initiatives were/will be discussed at the Ecoschools event, and experts from these projects will 
      even advise the United Nations COP26 Climate Conference.
